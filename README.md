# Movie recommendation

About a year ago, I made a Spotify Recommendation project that I wasn't quite proud of, because it wouldn't work like a normal recommendation system. In this project, I used [the movielens dataset](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip) to create a more realistic model. The model is hybrid ( it both uses content-based filtering and collaborative filtering ).

Then, I turned this model into an API using FastAPI and rendered it in a website. The results are quite satisfying to me.

If you want to test it, here are the following steps:

- Req.txt
- ngrok
- heroku
- custom url
